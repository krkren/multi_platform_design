<dd>Property of the <a class="jump" href="class_Layer.html">Layer class</a></dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Indicates whether the layer has an image.<br />
This value can also be set.<br />
If set to true, the layer will have an image.<br />
This is the default.<br />
If set to false, the layer's image is released and the layer will no longer have an image.<br />
Setting the Layer.type property resets hasImage to true.<br />
If the layer does not have an image and Layer.type is ltOpaque, the layer is displayed as being completely filled with Layer.neutralColor.<br />
For other types, it is treated as completely transparent.<br />
If this property is false and Layer.hitType is htMask, the entire layer is considered to have an opacity of 0 (completely transparent).<br />
Additionally, drawing and font operations cannot be performed.<br />
Layers with this property set to false are typically used to group multiple child layers while remaining transparent themselves.</p>
