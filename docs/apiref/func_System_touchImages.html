<dt>Arguments</dt>
<dd><table rules="all" frame="box" cellpadding="3" summary="touchImages arguments">
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="argname">storages</span></td>
<td><p>Pass an array (Array class object) of image storage names you want to put into the cache.<br />
Items listed earlier have higher priority.<br />
KiriKiri manages the cache using the string specified in the first argument of Layer.loadImages as the key. Therefore, for the cache to be effective, the image storage names specified here must be identical to those passed as the first argument to Layer.loadImages.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="argname">limitbytes</span></td>
<td><p>Specifies the limit for cache capacity used by this method call in bytes.<br />
If 0 is specified, the entire cache is used. If a positive number is specified, it attempts to use the cache up to that number of bytes.<br />
If a negative number is specified, the limit is calculated by adding that value to the current cache limit ( System.graphicCacheLimit ) (since it's a negative number, it effectively subtracts it).<br />
If the resulting limit is 0 or negative, this method terminates without doing anything.<br />
For example, if -2*1024*1024 is specified, it is treated as if the current cache limit minus 2MB was specified.<br />
This is useful when you want to leave some free space in the cache.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><span class="argname">timeout</span></td>
<td><p>Specifies the timeout (time limit) in ms. Specifying 0 makes it unlimited.<br />
This method will stop loading subsequent images and return once the time specified by this argument has elapsed.<br />
However, even if a timeout occurs while loading a specific image, it will not return until that image's loading is complete.</p>
</td></tr>

<dt>Return Value</dt>
<dd>None (void)</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>This method attempts to load the specified images into the cache.<br />
However, while this method makes an effort to put images into the cache, there is no guarantee that the images will actually be cached.<br />
Image loading is interrupted if the image cache limit is exceeded or a timeout occurs.<br />
Among the items specified in the storages argument, those listed earlier have a higher priority for being cached.<br />
If a specified image is already in the cache, it simply raises its priority within the cache.<br />
This method ignores all errors during image loading.<br />
In the current version, images that can be cached with this method are those normally loadable via Layer.loadImages and which do not specify a color key (images with alpha channels are fine).<br />
Rule images for universal transitions or region images will be loaded, but they will not become valid cache data (the loaded data will be wasted), so please do not specify them.<br />
Refer to System.graphicCacheLimit for the number of bytes images use in the cache.</p>
