<dd><p>Returns the dpi value.<br />
Read-only.<br />
On Windows, this is the value obtained via GetDeviceCaps.<br />
On Android, this is a configuration value, and several types of values are returned based on the screen size.<br />
When excluding input such as swipe-ins from the side of the screen, Android recognizes (int)(20 * displayDensity + 0.5) as the screen edge range. Therefore, if a touchDown occurs within this range, it should be treated as a swipe-in.<br />
On Android, functions are assigned to swipe-ins from directions other than the right during full-screen mode, so it is recommended to ignore inputs determined to be swipe-ins.<br />
When you want to display a menu, it is common on Android to use a swipe-in from the right for menu display.</p>
