<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Configures the system to call the missing method when a member is not found.<br />
If a member is not found in an object registered with this method, a method is called in the format: function missing( isset, name, prop ).<br />
isset is true for setting (assignment) and false for getting (retrieval).<br />
name is the name of the member that was not found.<br />
prop is the value to be assigned when setting, or the destination for the return value when getting.<br />
If the member name is still not found even within the missing method, return a non-zero value.<br />
Returning a non-zero value will cause a "member not found" exception to be raised.<br />
Even if a function is not found, it is called as a "get".<br />
Since the finalize function is also subject to this, it is recommended to define a finalize function in classes using this setting.</p>
