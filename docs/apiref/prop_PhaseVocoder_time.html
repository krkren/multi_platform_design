<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the scale along the time axis. This value can also be set.<br />
The value must be a real number greater than 0.<br />
However, extremely small values will increase the CPU load, and in the worst case, playback may not be possible.<br />
Also, sound quality degrades when the value exceeds approximately 1.95, and increasing the overlap may not improve the quality (this is due to the characteristics of the internal algorithm).<br />
If 1.0 is specified, the time axis scale does not change (playback speed remains the same).<br />
For example, if 1.5 is specified, the time axis scale becomes 1.5 times larger, and playback becomes slower (it will take 1.5 times longer to play).<br />
For example, if 0.5 is specified, the time axis scale becomes 0.5 times, and playback becomes faster (it will play at double speed).<br />
Even if both the time property and the pitch property are 1, the Phase Vocoder filter still operates, which slightly degrades sound quality and consumes CPU time.<br />
If you intend to use both at 1, it is better to remove this filter from the filter array.<br />
Changes to this property are reflected in real-time, but due to buffering, it takes about 2 seconds before the change is actually heard in playback.<br />
Additionally, noise may occur during the transition.</p>
