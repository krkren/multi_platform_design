<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents a pointer to the upper-left corner of the main image buffer (a 32bpp bitmap containing color and mask (opacity) information).<br />
This property is intended to provide a means of direct access to the image buffer for plugins and similar purposes.<br />
It is returned as an integer type, but in plugins, it should be cast to an appropriate type (such as unsigned long *).<br />
Unlike Layer.mainImageBuffer, values can be written to the pointer obtained through this property.<br />
Internally, KiriKiri shares identical images between multiple layers, but accessing this property will break that sharing state (copy-on-write).<br />
If no image is assigned to the layer, NULL (0) is returned.<br />
The image size is represented by the Layer.imageWidth and Layer.imageHeight properties.<br />
Refer to Layer.mainImageBufferPitch for how to calculate the pointer address.</p>
