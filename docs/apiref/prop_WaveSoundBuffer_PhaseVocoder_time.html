<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the scale along the time axis. This value can also be set. The value must be a real number greater than 0. However, values that are too small will increase CPU load, and in the worst case, playback may not be possible. Also, sound quality deteriorates around values exceeding 1.95, and increasing the overlap may not improve the quality (due to characteristics of the internal algorithm). Specifying 1.0 does not change the time axis scale (playback speed remains unchanged). For example, specifying 1.5 makes the time axis scale 1.5 times larger, resulting in slower playback (it will take 1.5 times longer to play). For example, specifying 0.5 makes the time axis scale 0.5 times smaller, resulting in faster playback (it will play at double speed).\n Even if both the time and pitch properties are set to 1, the Phase Vocoder filter still operates, slightly degrading sound quality and consuming CPU time. If you intend to keep both at 1, it is better to remove this filter from the filter array. Changes to this property are reflected in real-time, but due to buffering, it takes about 2 seconds before the change is actually heard. Also, noise may occur during the transition.\n</p>
