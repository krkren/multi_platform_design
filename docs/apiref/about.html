<h1>KiriKiri Z Multi-platform Version API Reference</h1>

<p>This is the KiriKiri Z Multi-platform Version API Reference.</p>

<h1>About the Multi-platform Version</h1>

<p>This is a version that runs on Android in addition to Windows.  <br />
GPU rendering is the main focus to achieve drawing speed even in weak environments.  <br />
Currently, there is some incompatibility with the old version.</p>

<h1>Environment-Dependent Functions</h1>

<p>Not all methods and properties can be used in all environments in the multi-platform version.  <br />
Some functions are environment-specific.  <br />
For environment-specific methods, etc., [Windows] or [Android] is written at the beginning of the description outline.  <br />
Methods etc. written in that way can only be used in that environment.  <br />
Some do nothing when called, and some throw exceptions.  <br />
For details, please use the following suffix symbols to determine.  </p>

<ul>
<li>[Windows+] Usable only on Windows, prohibited in other environments because exceptions or undefined behavior may occur.</li>
<li>[Windows*] Usable on Windows, does nothing in other environments.</li>
<li>[Windows] Usable on Windows, behavior is undefined in other environments.</li>
<li>[Android+] Usable only on Android, prohibited in other environments because exceptions or undefined behavior may occur.</li>
<li>[Android*] Usable on Android, does nothing in other environments.</li>
<li>[Android] Usable on Android, behavior is undefined in other environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can dynamically determine which environment you are in by using the System.isWindows and System.isAndroid properties.<br />
To determine statically, use the preprocessor.<br />
In Windows, "windows" is set to 1, and in Android, "android" is set to 1.  <br />
When determining statically, note that the output result of the bytecode depends on the environment.  <br />
Bytecode for the compiled environment will be output.  <br />
To avoid this, it is necessary to change the value of the preprocessor in advance before calling the compile function, make it suitable for each environment, and convert it into bytecode.</p>
