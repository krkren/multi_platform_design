<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the scale along the frequency axis. You can also set this value. The value must be greater than 0.0. Specifying 1.0 results in no change to the frequency axis scale (the pitch remains the same). For example, specifying 1.0594630943593 raises the pitch by one semitone. For example, specifying 0.9438743126817 lowers the pitch by one semitone. Even if both the time and pitch properties are set to 1, the Phase Vocoder filter remains active, causing slight sound quality degradation and consuming CPU time. If you intend to keep both at 1, it is recommended to remove this filter from the filter array. Changes to this property are reflected in real-time, but due to buffering, it may take about 2 seconds before the change is actually heard in playback.\n</p>
