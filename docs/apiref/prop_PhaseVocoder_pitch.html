<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the scale along the frequency axis.<br />
This value can also be set.<br />
The value must be greater than 0.0.<br />
Specifying 1.0 results in no change to the frequency axis scale (the pitch remains unchanged).<br />
For example, specifying 1.0594630943593 raises the pitch by one semitone.<br />
For example, specifying 0.9438743126817 lowers the pitch by one semitone.<br />
Even if both the time and pitch properties are set to 1, the Phase Vocoder filter remains active, which may slightly degrade sound quality and consume CPU time.<br />
If both are to remain at 1, it is recommended to remove this filter from the filter array.<br />
Changes to this property are reflected in real-time, but due to buffering, it takes approximately 2 seconds before the change is audible in playback.</p>
