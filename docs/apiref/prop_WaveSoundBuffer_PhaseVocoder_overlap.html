<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the overlap count (oversampling factor). Specify 0 or a power of 2 between 2 and 32. The default is 0. If 0 is specified, an appropriate value is set according to the current value of the time property. Increasing this value increases the resolution in the time axis direction. It is recommended to use a larger value especially when slowing down the playback speed. Increasing the value will use more CPU. Changes to this property are reflected in real time, but due to buffering, it takes about 2 seconds before it is actually played. Also, noise may occur during the transition.\n</p>
