<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the overlap count (oversampling factor).<br />
Specify 0 or a power of 2 between 2 and 32.<br />
The default is 0.<br />
If 0 is specified, an appropriate value is set according to the current value of the time property.<br />
Increasing this value improves the resolution in the time axis direction.<br />
It is recommended to use a higher value especially when slowing down the playback speed.<br />
Increasing the value will result in higher CPU usage.<br />
Changes to this property are reflected in real-time, but due to buffering, it takes about 2 seconds before the change is actually heard in playback.<br />
Also, noise may occur during the transition.</p>
