<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the event occurrence interval.<br />
The value can also be set.<br />
The unit is ms (milliseconds), and events occur at the specified time intervals.<br />
The interval can also be specified as a real number.<br />
In the current version, it can be specified with a precision of 1/65536 milliseconds (decimal values are rounded to this precision).<br />
Even with a precision of approximately 1/65536 milliseconds, there is no guarantee that the event handler will actually be called with this level of accuracy.<br />
In reality, there is a jitter of about 3-10ms in the timing of event calls.<br />
However, on average and over the long term, automatic adjustments are made so that events occur at the interval specified by this property.</p>
