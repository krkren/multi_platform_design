<dd>Property of the <a class="jump" href="class_Layer.html">Layer class</a></dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Indicates whether to perform caching.<br />
This value can also be set.<br />
When caching is enabled, a pre-rendered image of the layer and all its children composited together is maintained. As long as no changes are made to the layer or its children, image operations for compositing them will not be performed (the cache is automatically reconstructed if changes occur). When caching is disabled, compositing operations are performed every time the screen is updated. By default, caching is not performed, but it is automatically enabled during transitions (however, this property does not reflect the state of caching that is automatically enabled during transitions, etc.).<br />
In cases where it is known that the images and states of a layer and its children will not change, but the screen is frequently redrawn, enabling caching for that layer will improve overall performance.</p>
