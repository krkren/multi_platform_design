<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Specifies how many events can be generated at one time.<br />
You can also set this value.<br />
When processing takes longer than the timer interval, timer events may not be processed in time.<br />
In such cases, the timer stores events in the event queue, but there is a limit to the number of events that can be stored.<br />
This property specifies that maximum number.<br />
When it is time to process events, Kirikiri will attempt to process all events stored in the queue at once.<br />
If set to 1, the event queue will store at most one event.<br />
If set to 0, there is no limit to the number of events in the queue, but be careful as the system may appear to freeze if too many events accumulate.<br />
The default is 6.</p>
