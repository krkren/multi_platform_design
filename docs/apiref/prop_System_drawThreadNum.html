<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the number of threads used by the KiriKiri layer system during drawing.<br />
This value can also be set.<br />
If dtnAuto is specified, the same number of threads as the number of processors recognized by the OS will be automatically assigned.<br />
Setting multiple drawing threads may improve drawing performance in multi-core environments, but it may also decrease performance in some cases.<br />
Good results may be obtained by applying this to processes with large drawing areas, high-load Affine-related processes, or heavy layer composition calculations.<br />
Even if set to use multi-threading, if the system determines that the drawing load is light and the effect of multi-threading cannot be obtained, it may not be executed in multi-threaded mode.</p>
